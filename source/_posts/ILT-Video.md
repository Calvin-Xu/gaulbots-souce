Hi everyone! We performed above our own expectations at the ILT, winning every qualification match and consistently scoring near 200 points by ourselves.

However, we experienced disconnection issues in the semifinal rounds, likely due to electrostatic discharge, that disabled us. In the end we ranked 5th among the 26 teams in the competition, and were the first runner-up to the Control Award. Unfortunately, we will not be able to enter the regionals.

It has been a great season. Everyone on 358 has grown and had fun. We thank our mentors Mr. Walker and Mr. Hamilton. No regrets. Letâ€™s do better next year!

Check out us scoring 197 Points **solo** at Qualification 19:
