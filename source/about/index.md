# Mission Statement

We are team 358, the Gaulbots, from the Webb Schools in Claremont, CA. Our robotics program is part of Webb's afternoon activity system in which every student is required to participate in some activity after the school day. This year, we are lucky to have 4 experienced seniors and juniors on our team to help mentor our less experienced members learn the ropes of robotics. Everyone has shown considerable dedication to the team and a desire to learn, creating a collaborative working environment. We receive support from our school both financially and personally. We, along with our sister team, 359, are led by our mentors, teachers at our school, who happen to be experienced in FIRST as well as in various fields of engineering. This year, we are hosts to the meets in our league so our members set up and clean up before and after every meet.

# Team History

Founded in August of 2007, Webb’s Robotics program has been active for 12 years, and team 359 has existed for 8 years. This is the team’s 12th year participating in FTC.

During August 2007, the Webb Robotics program began as the engineering class for the Webb Schools of California. There, the program registered two teams, 358 & 359. The team was founded by the current mentor Mr. Walker and had its first debut in the 2007-08 season. During the 2011-12 season, the program moved from a class-based system which met 4 times a week for an hour or less to an afternoon activity which met 5 times a week for about 2 hours every day, significantly increasing the amount of time we got to work with the robot. The program also retired team 359 since the amount of members at that time wasn’t enough to fill both teams. During that season, 358 achieved the Finalist Alliance in Las Vegas FTC Regional Championship Tournament, and won the Compass Award in San Diego Regional Championship Tournament.

In the 2012-13 season, the team was qualified for the World Championship in St. Louis for the game challenge Ring it Up. This was the furthest the team has ever advanced, and the team's competitions were live streamed to classes. This sudden success had an instant impact in the 2013-14 season: the number of members doubled and team 359 was brought back. From that moment on, the team has been competing at the highest level of competition, and the Webb Robotics program has become a respectable organization.

During years 2014 - 2015, the team went as far as regional division finalists and also won the Rockwell Collins Innovate award that celebrates the creativity of the team.

In the 2015-16 season, team 359 was on the Winning Alliance for both Los Angeles FTC Qualifying Tournament and Las Vegas FTC Regional Championship Tournament. On the latter competition, 359 also achieved the Finalist Alliance and the Connet Award.

In the 2016-17 season, team 359 won the PTC Design Award in Los Angeles FTC Interleague Tournament, while in the 2017-18 season, 359 was invited to the FTC World Championship Tournament.
